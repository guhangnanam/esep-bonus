# Data Processing and Storage - Extra Credit Assignment

## Contents
- `db.py`: Contains the inMemoryDB class implementation.
- `main.py`: Demonstrates usage of the inMemoryDB with example transactions.

## How to run
Make sure you have python installed
Run:
    python main.py

This will execute a series of commands that test:
- get()
- put()
- begin_transaction()
- commit()
- rollback()

All required functionality is demonstrated in the console output.

## How This Assignment Could Be Improved (Write Up)
I think this assignment could become an official assignment by perhaps raising its complexity slightly. The assignment feels kind of elementary, but that could be bias from me since I am a senior and this assignment feels more like something I would do in Programming Fundamentals 1 or 2. I still though the assignment was fun to complete though. Additionally, it would be nice if the assignment better specificed an API style or whether errors should return strings or something else. Better clarifications on how transactions should behave in unique edge cases would be nice. I like that the assignment is open ended and can be made in whatever language the student wants to do it in, but if the assignment were to be made official it would benefit with being standardized with a template or something similar since that would improve grading speed.
